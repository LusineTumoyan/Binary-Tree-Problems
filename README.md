# Binary-Tree-Problems
Solving some interesting problems related to binary trees.

All problems include a solution in both recursive and iterative ways.

1. Get the height of each subtree. Set the data of each node to it's subtree's height.
2. Get the average of each subtrees' data. Set the data of each node to it's subtree's average data.
3. Get the number of nodes with minimum childs.
4. Get the levels with minimum number of nodes.
5. Get nodes with only one child.
6. Get the number of leaves in a subtree. Set the data of a node to it's subtree's leaf count.
7. Check 2 trees on identical structure.
8. Get the number of missed nodes in a subtree. Set the data of a node to it's subtree's missed nodes count.
9. Get the number of nodes after a particular level.
10. Set the node data to the count of missed nodes in it's level / until the node from the root.
11. Get the sum of nodes' data until a particular level.
12. Get the node with minimum data in a level.
13. Copy a tree.
